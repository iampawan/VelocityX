///
/// A container/VxBox first surrounds the child with [padding] (inflated by any
/// borders present in the [decoration]) and then applies additional
/// [constraints] to the padded extent (incorporating the `width` and `height`
/// as constraints, if either is non-null). The container is then surrounded by
/// additional empty space described from the [margin].
///
/// During painting, the container first applies the given [transform], then
/// paints the [decoration] to fill the padded extent, then it paints the child,
/// and finally paints the [foregroundDecoration], also filling the padded
/// extent.
///
/// Containers with no children try to be as big as possible unless the incoming
/// constraints are unbounded, in which case they try to be as small as
/// possible. Containers with children size themselves to their children. The
/// `width`, `height`, and [constraints] arguments to the constructor override
/// this.
///
/// By default, boxes/containers return false for all hit tests. If the [color]
/// property is specified, the hit testing is handled by [ColoredBox], which
/// always returns true. If the [decoration] or [foregroundDecoration] properties
/// are specified, hit testing is handled by [Decoration.hitTest].
