/// Each child of a [ZStack] widget is either _positioned_ or _non-positioned_.
/// Positioned children are those wrapped in a [Positioned] widget that has at
/// least one non-null property. The stack sizes itself to contain all the
/// non-positioned children, which are positioned according to [alignment]
/// (which defaults to the top-left corner in left-to-right environments and the
/// top-right corner in right-to-left environments). The positioned children are
/// then placed relative to the stack according to their top, right, bottom, and
/// left properties.
///
/// The stack paints its children in order with the first child being at the
/// bottom. If you want to change the order in which the children paint, you
/// can rebuild the stack with the children in the new order. If you reorder
/// the children in this way, consider giving the children non-null keys.
/// These keys will cause the framework to move the underlying objects for
/// the children to their new locations rather than recreate them at their
/// new location.
///
/// For more details about the stack layout algorithm, see [RenderStack].
///
/// If you want to lay a number of children out in a particular pattern, or if
/// you want to make a custom layout manager, you probably want to use
/// [CustomMultiChildLayout] instead. In particular, when using a [ZStack] you
/// can't position children relative to their size or the stack's own size.
