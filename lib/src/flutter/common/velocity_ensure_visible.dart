/// Helper class that ensures a Widget is visible when it has the focus
/// For example, for a TextFormField when the keyboard is displayed
///
/// How to use it:
///
/// In the class that implements the Form,
///   Instantiate a FocusNode
///   FocusNode _focusNode = new FocusNode();
///
/// In the build(BuildContext context), wrap the TextFormField as follows:
///
///   new VxEnsureVisibleWhenFocused(
///     focusNode: _focusNode,
///     child: new TextFormField(
///       ...
///       focusNode: _focusNode,
///     ),
///   ),
///
/// Initial source code written by Collin Jackson & taken from one of his repo.
/// Extended (see highlighting) to cover the case when the keyboard is dismissed and the
/// user clicks the TextFormField/TextField which still has the focus.
///
